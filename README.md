# WordPress Docker Container

This Dockerfile installs WordPress 5x (with latest WP-CLI), nginx 1.16 and php-fpm 7.3 (ondemand PM) over Alpine Linux. Currently using it on multiple heavy load production sites without any issues.

Attached wp-config.php in this container is designed to use with configuration parameters as a environments variables, making its management lot easier.

nginx configuration has a lot of tweaks, and this container run a cron via system instead of WP cron because is not very reliable.

Currently image size is 183 MB, but the goal of this project is to slim it as possible.
